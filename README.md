### Hi there, I'm Lau! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a React and Node developer, latley working with Nextjs. If I need a script, I'll probably choose Deno. If I need styles, Tailwind is my current to-go option.

If you want to know me a little more, here are some fun facts:
  - Pineapple pizza and raisin empanadas? Hell yeah.
  - In Naruto's world I'm a Nara ðŸš«
  - I'm also a proud Hufflepuff ðŸ¦¡
  - I'm up to date with One Piece manga. I'm also reading Blue Lock and Jujutsu Kaisen.
  - I suck at League of Legends but I can't stop playing. Now I spend my free time in TFT.
  - I'm a huge hincha de Boca ðŸ’™â€‹ðŸ’›â€‹ðŸ’™â€‹.
  - My first answer is usually 'What did I break?'.
